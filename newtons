1.The temperature of a body drops from 100C to 75C in 10 minutes where
the surrounding air is at the temperature 20C . What will be the
temperature of the body after half an hour? Plot the graph of cooling.
Program:
import numpy as np
from sympy import *
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
t2=20 # surrounding temp
t1=100 # inital temp
# one reading t=1 minute temp is 75 degree
t=10
T=75
k1=(1/t)* log((t1-t2)/(T-t2))# k calculation
print ('k= ',k1)
k= Symbol('k')
t= Symbol('t')
T= Function('T')(t)
T=t2+(t1-t2)*exp(-k*t) # solution
print ('T=',T)
# ploting the solution curve
T=T.subs(k,k1)
T= lambdify(t,T)
t = np.linspace(0, 70)
plt.plot(t, T(t), color ='r')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
# When time t=30 minute T is
print('When time t=30 minute T is ,',T(30),'o C')
