1.Examine the consistency of the following system of equations and
solve if consistent:
x + 2y âˆ’ z = 1, 2x + y + 4z = 2, 3x + 3y + 4z = 1.

Program:
import numpy as np #Import necessary libraries
# Defining matrix A-coefficient matrix
A=np . matrix ([[1 ,2 ,-1],[2 ,1 , 4],[3 ,3 , 4]])
# Defining matrix B-matrix of constants
B=np . matrix ([[1],[2],[1]])
# Concatenating matrix A and B: [A:B]
AB=np . concatenate (( A , B ) , axis =1 )
rA=np . linalg . matrix_rank ( A ) # Computing rank of matrix A
rAB =np . linalg . matrix_rank ( AB ) # Computing rank of matrix AB
n=A . shape [1]#Computing order of matrix Aif ( rA==rAB ):#Checking for consistency
 if ( rA==n ):#Checking for unique solution
 print ("The system has unique solution ")
 print ( np . linalg . solve (A , B ) )
 else :
 print ("The system has infinitely many solutions ")
else :
 print ("The system of equations is inconsistent ")
